Liskov Substitution principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987.
The principle defines the objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

Example of Liskov substitution principle

There is class named move. Robot can move, but cant breathe, Robot class is a subtype of class Move, But is can't use the breathe method,
that means we are breaking the LSP principle.
